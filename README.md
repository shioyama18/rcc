# Rust C Compiler (rcc)
A toy C compiler written in Rust (In Progress)  
Compiler is following the instruction from the article - *Writing a C Compiler* (https://norasandler.com/archive/)  
Tests are taken from [this repo](https://github.com/nlsandler/write_a_c_compiler)  
I am at stage 3 right now.
